# Create a blog with Jekyll

Search "Jekyll Themes" on Google, and choose what you want.

Create a directory `git_work` in root directory.

Create a new repository `[Your GitHub Username].github.io` in GitHub, and copy its link.

Next, open the command prompt (or shell) and enter below:

{% shiki sh %}git clone [Your GitHub Username].github.io
{% endshiki %}

And, move the files that you chose the theme into `[Your GitHub Username].github.io` directory.
